    In other words, the prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has exactly two factors, 1 and the number itself.
    There are many prime numbers, such as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.
    Keep in mind that 1 cannot be either prime or composite.

-> Properties of prime numbers:

    Every number greater than 1 can be divided by at least one prime number.
    Every even positive integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.
    Except 2, all other prime numbers are odd. In other words, we can say that 2 is the only even prime number.
    Two prime numbers are always coprime to each other.
    Each composite number can be factored into prime factors and individually all of these are unique in nature.
